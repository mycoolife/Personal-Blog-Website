          <strong>James Austrums</strong> was perhaps the most iconic Scottish mountaineer of the early 20th century. He entered into the vertical world driven by a passion for ornithology. Scouring the sea-cliffs around the Scottish coastline for nesting birds soon turned to exploring the in-land mountain peaks. He was known locally for his first technical winter ascents on Ben Nevis (the tallest mountain in the United Kingdom at 1345m). Green Gully in 1906, Crowberry Gully in 1909 and then his most renowned climb of the Observatory Ridge in 1920.

          There‚Äôs no doubt by now that you‚Äôve seen us banging on about how beautiful the Scottish Highlands are and how much we loved our visit. From the stunning beauty of the Cairngorms, foraging for seaweed for lunch, the Wester Ross Trail and driving part of the North Coast 500 ‚Äì Scotland really spoilt us during our visit.
          Heading back north to Scotland was a homecoming, of sorts. Before Yaya started at Cambridge, we both studied at St. Andrews (on the east coast) but for some silly reason, we never made it into the Highlands. This trip was to remedy that fact!
        </p>
        <blockquote>After living in Scotland for about 4 years, I quickly realised that (just like much of the UK) that it‚Äôs not just a summer destination, there‚Äôs every reason to go out, explore and discover some of the hidden gems that we were itching to see.</blockquote>
        <p>
          Now, just like we mentioned in our other Highlands posts, the best thing about the hidden gems in Scotland is that they are literally just as beautiful and possibly even more stunning than some of the better-known places you‚Äôll likely have heard of. üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø
          Best of all, most of the places we found were actually so close to some of the better-known spots, meaning they can be easily tagged onto your trip if you‚Äôre looking for something a bit more hidden but no less iconic.

            To make life a little easier, we wanted to share the route that we drove around the Highlands so that you can dip into the regions, areas and experiences that you‚Äôd like yourself. Take a look at our full itinerary, below.
